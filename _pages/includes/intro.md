Hi! I am currently a first year PhD student at the Institute of Computing Technology(ICT), CAS. I will continue to learn and progress under the guidance of Prof. Yuanzhuo Wang and [Prof. Fei Sun](http://ofey.me/). Prior to that, thanks to the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Li](http://faculty.cau.edu.cn/xxdqxy/lx_7543/list.htm), I received my undergraduate degree from China Agricultural University majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interest includes Large Languege Models(LLMs), In-Context Learning(ICL) and Knowledge Editing in NLP.
