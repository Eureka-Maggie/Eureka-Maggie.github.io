Hi! I am currently a first year PhD student at the Institute of Computing Technology(ICT), CAS. I will continue to learn and progress under the guidance of Prof. Yuanzhuo Wang and [Prof. Fei Sun](http://ofey.me/). Prior to that, thanks to the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%8E%E6%83%B3/24148024), I received my undergraduate degree from China Agricultural University majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interest includes Large Languege Models(LLMs), In-Context Learning(ICL) and Knowledge Editing in NLP.
